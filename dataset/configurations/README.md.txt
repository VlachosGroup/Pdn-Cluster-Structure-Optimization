# Configurations (lattice graphs) in each active learning iteration
iteration_1 - 49 structures
iteration_2 - 40 structures
iteration_3 - 20 structures
iteration_4 - 13 structures

In each iteraction folder, 
- the folder png contains the atomic configurations 
- the folder lattice_graphs contains the mapping to the 3D lattice
